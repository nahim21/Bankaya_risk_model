# Risk Model Challenge for Bankaya

## Overview

Bankaya has presented a challenge to distinguish between good and risky customers for credit approval purposes. As part of the data science team, we are tasked to develop a predictive model that can assist in making better credit decisions for new customers seeking loans to purchase smartphones.

## Challenge Details

### Primary Task

The primary objective is to build a model that can predict whether a new customer is a good or risky credit candidate. This decision will be crucial in the loan approval process. The approach to developing this model is not restricted; any form of predictive model that is deemed suitable can be used. The key steps in the development process, including justifications and methodologies, should be thoroughly documented.

### Secondary Task (Optional)

For additional points, the challenge includes providing strategic recommendations on the practical use of the model, particularly in assigning interest rates to each client based on their risk profile. This is an opportunity to showcase additional insights on how to leverage predictive modeling in financial decision-making.

## Repository Structure

### `input/`

This directory contains the dataset provided for the model development. 

### `ML_functions/`

Here you will find a collection of functions used throughout the model's development and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### `notebook/`

This folder houses two essential files for the project:
- `model_visualization.html`: A static HTML file for users who wish to view the project's results without interacting with the codebase.
- `model_development.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code, EDA, and modeling steps.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before running the model, ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
